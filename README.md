# HibernateEmbeddedobject
This project demonstrates the use of Hibernate's @Embeddable annotation to create reusable, embedded objects within an entity. Using Hibernate ORM with MySQL, it provides an example of mapping complex data structures, showing how to embed multiple fields (such as NameInfo and AddressInfo) into a primary StudentInfo entity.
